title: The Harper Chrome Extension
---

Harper is free to use for the > 3.6 billion people out there using Chrome.
Unlike other grammar checking plugins out there, Harper's Chrome extension does all of its work offline.
We help improve the prose and grammar of your emails, messages, and documents, all while respecting your privacy.

To install it, visit the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/private-grammar-checking/lodbfhdipoipcjmlebjbgmmgekckhpfb) and click 'Add to Chrome'.

For our nerdy friends out there, you'll be happy to hear the Chrome extension is powered by [`harper.js`](/docs/harperjs/introduction).
