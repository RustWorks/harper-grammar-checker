## Your Voice Means Something

Harper checks your work for grammatical errors. That's it.

Other grammar checkers try to strip out everything that makes your writing unique.
We believe you should have the freedom to write what's on your mind, not what an LLM thinks you want to hear.
Harper is designed to be fast and **get out of the way**.

## Installation

For now, can install Harper into WordPress by downloading `harper.zip` from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Automattic/harper/releases/latest) and uploading it to your site.

Harper will be coming to the WordPress.org plugin directory soon. Hang tight!
